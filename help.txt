  rdr allows you to torward any hostname at any port to any IP at
  any port on your Mac.

    rdr [ <host>:<ip> to <ip>:<port> ]
        [ . | on | off | list ]
        --help
        --version

  Usually, you'll want the <ip>:<port> argument to be 127.0.0.1:<port>,
  so try something like: "rdr domain.com:80 to 127.0.0.1:3005"

  HOW IT WORKS:
    rdr will create and apply /etc/hosts rules to to point the domain
    to your IP, and pfctrl configuration rules to forward your ports.
